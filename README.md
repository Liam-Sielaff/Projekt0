# Pi-Game

A small console game where you guess the decimal digits of Ï€ (Pi).

## How it works

- It asks you for a randomly chosen decimal digit of Pi.
- You enter the digit at that position.
- Enter `q` to quit the game at any time.

## How to start

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python3 pi-game.py
```

## Example

Enter the 17th decimal digit of pi (or 'q' to quit): 9
Correct!
Enter the 42nd decimal digit of pi (or 'q' to quit): q
Game ended.
```
